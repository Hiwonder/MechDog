## Product Overview

### About MechDog

We created MechDog with a clear vision: to build a truly accessible, high-performance, and fun-to-tinker-with quadruped robot. By combining precise mechanics, open-source code, and a beginner-friendly programming ecosystem, we aim to lower the barrier to robotics for everyone—from students taking their first steps with Scratch, to makers prototyping with Arduino, to engineers exploring complex behaviors with Python. This is more than a kit; it's a compact, agile platform designed to bring your wildest robotic ideas to life.

### Built for Agile Movement & Real-World Learning

At its heart, MechDog is a marvel of accessible engineering. It's powered by 8 high-speed coreless servos that deliver exceptional torque and responsiveness, enabling swift and stable walking. The secret to its lifelike agility lies in the built-in inverse kinematics algorithms, which run on the capable ESP32 controller. This allows you to command the dog's body position and orientation in real-time, adjusting gait, direction, and posture with ease for remarkably fluid and natural movements.

### Open, Hackable, and Infinitely Expandable

As a fully open-source platform, MechDog is designed to grow with your skills. It welcomes a variety of programming approaches: visualize logic with Scratch (WonderCode), dive into embedded control with Arduino (C/C++), or implement advanced AI and automation with Python. Creativity doesn't stop at code—MechDog features expansion ports for ultrasonic, IMU, and other sensors, and its structure is compatible with LEGO® components, inviting endless physical modifications and project ideas.
